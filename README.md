When we run the above code in command prompt by specifying "python whats.py"
It prompts for phone number and a message.
We can enter many phone numbers by giving a space in between them.
Example:
enter ph no: 91xxxxxxx 91xxxxxxxxx 91xxxxxxxxxx 
enter message: Hi, this is chandana.
That's it, the message is sent automatically.
